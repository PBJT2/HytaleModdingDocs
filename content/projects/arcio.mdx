## Introduction

**Arcio** is a mana-driven automation mod for Hytale-designed to feel approachable, visually obvious, and powerful at scale. Imagine wiring glowing mana threads through a factory: everything is visible, directional, and behaves predictably.

- **Accessible by design:** Clear tools and visible connections let new players create meaningful automation quickly.
- **Deep and performant:** The systems scale to large builds and enable advanced users to craft compact CPUs and optimised transport networks.

**How it works - at a glance**

- Use **Sigil Matrix** gates to build deterministic binary logic (AND / OR / NOT / XOR and friends).
- Route directional **Manathreads** with the Needle Tool and organize flows with Arc Relays.

## Why Arcio?

- Thematically fitting to Hytale's magical world: _Magic is all around already_, we just give you the tools to harness it.
- It _"just works like magic"_: the systems are intentionally opinionated so common patterns are simple to build.
- Thriving with _personality_: visible connections and clear tools make it easy to understand and debug builds.
- Connecting components is as simple as **pointing and clicking**, no need to make space for bulky lanes or pipes.
- _Easy to learn, easy to master_: beginners can create functional builds quickly, while advanced users can optimize and scale.

## MVP Features

- **Binary Logic & Sigils:** Named, optimised logic gates so you can build complex CPUs without friction.
- **Manathreads & Wiring Tools:** Visible, directional wiring + the Needle Tool for neat, traceable layouts.
- **Compact Design:** Build dense systems - connections float as magical threads, not bulky pipes.

## Planned features

- **Leylight Transport:** A scalable, mana-costed item network (Arc Funnels, Chromatic Emitters, Focal Arrays, Arc Depots).
- **Circuit Boards:** Nestable, placeable circuits with export/import and share codes for the community.
- **Modder API:** Hooks for other mod authors to extend Arcio's mana and logic primitives.
- **Open Source plans post launch**
- (and more secret stuff 🧙)
